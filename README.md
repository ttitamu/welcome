# TTI GitHub Community

Welcome to the TTI GitHub Community, a collaborative community in furtherance of open source, open data, and open government efforts. To encourage open dialog, the community is a private community, with only TTI employees having access.

## Who's eligible?

Anyone with a TTI email address is encouraged to participate. That means if your email ends in `tti.tamu.edu`, you are eligible. Also, you need to be human. Agency accounts and robots need not apply.

## How to join

In order to join the community, we must first confirm that you are, in fact, a TTI employee:

1. If you don't already have one, [sign up](http://github.com/join) for a GitHub account. GitHub accounts should be personal to you. Human-sounding names like @benbalter are preferred over organization-specific names like @benbalter_tti.

2. Ensure that your TTI email is associated with your account. If you already have a GitHub account, you can simply [add your TTI email address](https://github.com/settings/emails) to your account.

3. [Confirm your TTI email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-email-verification).

4. Visit [github.tti.tamu.edu](https://github.tti.tamu.edu/ttitamu) in your web browser.

5. You should be automatically added and redirected to the TTI GitHub Community. You now have access to and can participate in discussions and private repositories available at [github.com/ttitamu](https://github.com/ttitamu).
